* Make sure to provide tests, e.g. Unit Tests
* Make sure to test your changes as thoroughly as possible before you commit them
* Make sure to use the following prefixes for your branch: `fix`/`feature`, e.g. `feature/meaningful-name`

    * Exception: If you explicitly need feedback you can open a PR and mark it as draft
